extensionDescriptionIntro = Mozilla is running a series of studies to evaluate a service that keeps DNS providers from collecting and sharing your browsing history. All users in the study will receive a notification. When a study is active, Firefox will automatically use Cloudflare’s 1.1.1.1 secure DNS over HTTPS. This study will use the Cloudflare resolver in addition to the DNS selected by a user or their ISP in order to compare approaches.

extensionDescriptionDataTitle = What happens to your data
extensionDescriptionDataDesc = Cloudflare, like any other DNS provider, needs access to the host names you use to resolve requests. We’ve chosen Cloudflare as our partner for these studies because, unlike many other DNS providers, they agreed to strong privacy controls that include limits on what data they collect and how long they keep it, as well a promise to not share data with other parties.

studyIntro = Domain Name Service (DNS) is one of the oldest parts of internet architecture, yet remains largely untouched by efforts to make the web safer and more private. On the Firefox team, we’re working to change that. We’ve already implemented the DNS over HTTPS (DoH) protocol in {brandShortName} and are studying a service that keeps DNS providers from collecting and sharing your browsing history.
